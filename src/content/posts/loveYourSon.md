### Act 1: Manhood

#### Dear Baba,

I don’t know if you’ll ever hear this, but I’ve been writing this letter for years, in my head, in the silence of the night when you come to me, when I see you every time I look in the mirror. I rewrite this letter when I dream about you. I go over it again and again, trying to shape the words more clearly, trying to say what I need to say. It never feels like the words I have will ever be enough. Every time I put pen to paper, it feels like the ink should have never hit the page. I would ideally want this to be perfect, but that's impossible. Here’s my best shot. This is my thank you. My search. My grief. My love. All in one.

In the Afghan tradition, there’s a famous proverb that goes like this:

> **"Manhood is not in dying, but in how you live.”**

There are many definitions of what it means to be a man, and to embrace one’s masculinity. To be quite honest, I never understood what it meant. And to this day, that question is yet to be answered.

As the son of immigrant parents, there’s almost a cognitive dissonance that one experiences. The differentiating cultures. The varying norms of the Afghan tradition, against the American / and Western view of what it means to be a man. As a kid, I struggled immensely with this dissonance. I didn’t know what it meant to be a man. What did it mean? How should I be? How am I supposed to act? What are my responsibilities? Is there a list of qualifications that I need?

And what would one do in my position? Well, they would do what any other kid would do. I looked towards you for direction.”

Baba, you didn’t directly teach me how to be a man, it was more… indirect. It was through your actions. You were a very interesting man. Some would say that you were troubled, of course, but there was a beauty to your nature nature. I took on your characteristics, at least that’s what others in our family tell me.

The way that I walk with my hands crossed behind my back.
The way in which I pace around a room. All down to the fine-grained detail.

The one aspect of you that I remember vividly, is your extremely loving nature. Paired with your frustration, was love. With your deep sadness, came love. Even with your God damn pride, there were seeds of love buried in there, somehow, and someway there was always this presence of purity in the way that you loved your family.

All in all, you were love, in human form, to me at least. Your display of masculinity was not of the Afghan tradition, nor the American tradition. You were something different. You were unique, you were something special Dad. I’ve never seen a human being as complex as you. As a 17 year old, I have you as my point of reference of what it means to be a man. An extremely complex, and loving man.

Baba, you were a man of conviction. When you believed in something, you believed it with your entire heart; your entire soul; your entire being as is.

Now, not everybody is perfect of course, and I don’t disregard your flaws. But, you did your best given what you grew up with.
