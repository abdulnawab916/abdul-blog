# Abdul's Blog

A personal digital space for my reflections, writing, and ongoing documentary project titled **"Love, your Son."**

## About

This project is both a personal archive and a public platform where I document stories, especially those centered around my late father, identity, masculinity, grief, and culture. Inspired by typography, minimalism, and digital journaling, this blog serves as a living artifact of my creative and emotional process.
